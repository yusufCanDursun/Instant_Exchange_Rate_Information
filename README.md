📊 Instant Exchange Rate Information

Instant Exchange Rate Information is a project designed to retrieve real-time exchange rate data via an API, store the information in InfluxDB, and visualize the currency fluctuations over time using Grafana.

The application continuously fetches exchange rate data from an external API and writes it into an InfluxDB instance. By connecting Grafana to InfluxDB, users can visualize and track the live changes in exchange rates in an easy-to-understand graphical format.
